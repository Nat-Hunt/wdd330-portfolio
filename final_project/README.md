Current status:

1. Wireframes are replicated mostly, some spacing and sizing needs to be updated.
2. All views are able to be transitioned to without error.
3. Saving and loading game states and settings works. Further testing on Ball, Player1, and Player2 objects is needed.

TODO:

1. Add animations and methods to move the player paddles
2. Update styles to actually look good. Going for a Retro look.
