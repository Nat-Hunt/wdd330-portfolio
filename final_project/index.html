    <h1>A History of Pong</h1>
    <div id="">
      <p>
        Pong is a table tennis-themed twitch arcade sports video game, featuring
        simple two-dimensional graphics, manufactured by Atari and originally
        released in 1972. It was one of the earliest arcade video games; it was
        created by Allan Alcorn as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari
        co-founder Nolan Bushnell, but Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney
        were surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work and decided to
        manufacture the game. Bushnell based the game's concept on an electronic
        ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video
        game console. In response, Magnavox later sued Atari for patent
        infringement.

        Pong was the first commercially successful video game, and it helped to
        establish the video game industry along with the Magnavox Odyssey. Soon
        after its release, several companies began producing games that closely
        mimicked its gameplay. Eventually, Atari's competitors released new
        types of video games that deviated from Pong's original format to
        varying degrees, and this, in turn, led Atari to encourage its staff to
        move beyond Pong and produce more innovative games themselves.

        Atari released several sequels to Pong that built upon the original's
        gameplay by adding new features. During the 1975 Christmas season, Atari
        released a home version of Pong exclusively through Sears retail stores.
        The home version was also a commercial success and led to numerous
        clones. The game was remade on numerous home and portable platforms
        following its release. Pong is part of the permanent collection of the
        Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., due to its cultural impact.
