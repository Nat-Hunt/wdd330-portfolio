                <h2>How to Rewire Your Brain for Mobile First UX</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>"If you design for the smallest, least powerful device first, 
                        then you will focus on the content, and your core functionality.
                        That leads to simple, beautiful apps. If you do it the other way 
                        around, it'll be like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy 
                        bank, which is neither simple, nor beautiful" 
                        Joel Marsh-The Hipper Element</li>
                    <li>Everything we build must be viewable from small watches to large 
                        TVs</li>
                    <li>2-3 devices per person, per household.</li>
                    <li>Mobile first is not Responsive Retrofitting (adjusting what 
                        already exists to be mobile compatible). Responsive Retrofitting 
                        is a good short-term solution to the problem. Keep in mind that 
                        Responsive Retrofitting <strong>doesn't address</strong> touch 
                        screen interaction or mobile screen real estate issues. </li>
                    <li>Mobile first downside: a full rebuild is time consuming and costly. 
                        <strong>However</strong>, it does ensure the best experience 
                        across the most devices.</li>
                    <li>Mobile First is, "future friendly and ready for growth"</li>
                    <li>Start small and scale up (perhaps when I am developing, I 
                        should keep chrome's Dev Tools opened and the sample screen
                        scaled to a mobile size. I should also double check it's 
                        functionality on my mobile device after publishing it to GitHub)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How to Improve UX by Understanding Users</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>"It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of 
                        times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them" 
                        Steve Jobs-Apple</li>
                    <li>Don't listen to what they say, observe behavior and design 
                        solutions</li>
                    <li>3 Things to do:<ol>
                        <li>Be There (Immediate)</li>
                        <li>Be Useful (Relevant). Don't make users hunt for what they
                            want. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Be Quick (Frictionless). Reduce their cognitive load.
                            Don't provide extra steps.
                        </li>
                    </ol></li>
                    <li>75% of people rely on thumbs when using their mobile device.
                        49% rely on a one-handed grip. Ensure that the content is easily
                        reachable from either side of the screen. The top of the screen 
                        is the most difficult spot of the device to reach. Make navigation
                        and important primary controls of an app accessible from the bottom
                        of the screen.
                    </li>
                    <li>Speed matters. Not everybody has the latest and greatest speeds.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Reduce image usage. SVG/Webfonts are lower bandwidth. 
                                They look good on small and large screens</li>
                            <li>Ensure that CSS and JS files are as optimized and small
                                as possible. Minify the files after development</li>
                            <li>GZIP files to eliminate unnecessary data</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Better Mobile UX with Strategic Menu Design</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The trouble with software is... it sucks. That's not a nice 
                        thing to say... but it is a fundamental truth. Software customers 
                        -- you, me, CIOs of multibillion-dollar companies...have learned 
                        to live with mediocre software. We do not ocunt on software to be 
                        intuitively easy to understand or to work consistently. Instead, 
                        we make do." Stewart Alsop-Venture Capitalist</li>
                    <li>Make sure most commonly used menu items are located at the 
                        bottom of the screen. (This creates the perception of speed)
                    </li>
                    <li>Most of the time, users won't tell you there's a problem.
                        They'll just go to another website or download another app.
                        Make 'em happy off-the-bat and perform high quality research.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Designing Intuitive and Mobile Friendly Forms</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>"[The constraints of Mobile] push you toward more focused, 
                        simplified solutions. You can only fit so much on the screen, 
                        people often have to wait for it, and they're unlikely to give 
                        you their full attention. So make it easy to understand and use 
                        and focus on the important things first. Mobile is a great 
                        forcing function for simplicity." Luke Wroblewski - Co-Founder of 
                        Polar and Bagcheck</li>
                    <li>Don't put labels to the side. Use float labels. They make sure
                        that the form doesn't look cramped and that users don't forget
                        what they're filling in.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make the inputs a bit taller than normal, this makes it easier
                        for users to tap on them without "targetting" the input box.
                    </li>
                    <li>Reduce the number of fields to only require the necessary 
                        information for the purpose of the form.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pagenate the form (break it into sections). Ensure that there is 
                        some form of progress indicator.
                    </li>
                    <li>Enable auto-complete!</li>
                    <li>Passwords are important! Allow an option to hide/show the password 
                        they're typing in. "Typically, masking passwords doesn't even 
                        increase security, but it does cost you business due to login
                        failures." - Nielsen Norman Group</li>
                    <li>For credit cards: <ol>
                        <li>Auto-advance to the next field</li>
                        <li>Space the card numbers using spaces/dashes</li>
                        <li>Provide visual cues for where to find the information</li>
                        <li>Consider placing it all in one-line</li>
                    </ol></li>
                    <li>Use the best keyboard for the information asked for. When taking
                        numbers, use the keypad.
                    </li>
                    <li>Don't force a copy and paste for calling. You can use an "a" 
                        tag to auto-call a number when it's clicked. For example my 
                        personal cell:<a href="tel:17573180453">757-318-0453</a></li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Designing a Better Mobile Advertising User Experience</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>"End-users, not technologies, shape the market. Consequently 
                        marketers need to stay abreast not only of technological 
                        developments but also of the way people respond to them" 
                        Matt Haig - Author</li>
                    <li>Make ads small and simple rather than large and intrusive.</li>
                    <li>Ads should not obscure content.</li>
                    <li>You can still use large ads, just don't make them large to begin
                        with. Use a smaller ad to entice a click, then when the click 
                        occurs you can roll out a larger ad with an obvious closing button.
                    </li>
                    <li>Video ads are popular right now and usually result in higher
                        traffic.
                    </li>
                    <li>Another idea is to show a large ad in a window behind the content
                        displayed during gaps between large sections or divs.
                    </li>
                    <li>"The fallen state of our internet is a direct, if unintentional, 
                        consequence of choosing advertising as the default model to support
                        online content and services." Ethan Zuckerman - Creator of the 
                        Pop-up ad
                    </li>
                    <li>STOP USING POP-UPS/POP-OVERS</li>
                    <li><strong>Remember! Content-first.</strong></li>
